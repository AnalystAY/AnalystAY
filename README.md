# AnalystAY

Welcome — this is my first repository on GitHub and the start of my public portfolio. I'm learning, building, and collecting projects here to showcase my skills, experiments, and progress.

## About
This repo is a personal hub for projects, notes, and small demos as I learn new tools and technologies. It's a living portfolio that will grow over time.

Goals:
- Share code samples and finished projects
- Track learning progress
- Practice documentation and good repo hygiene
- Showcase skills to potential employers or collaborators

## Technologies & skills
- Excel
- Python 
- SQL / SQLite
- Data visualization
- Git & GitHub

## Contributing
This is primarily a personal portfolio, but feedback and small fixes are welcome:
- Open an issue to suggest improvements
- Submit a pull request for small fixes or additions
